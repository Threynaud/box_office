# box_office
This is the my first project at Metis.

My goal was to predict box office revenues for movies using the data I scraped from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/.

I chose to use graph theory, a branch of mathematics I love, for features engineering.

The code is messy, this was my first project and I will clean that code when I will have time.

You can have a look at the results in the presentation, visually astonishing.

Email me every question you have at thmsreynaud@gmail.com, I will be glad to answer them.
